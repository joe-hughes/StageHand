# StageHand
A python project to enhance the workflow of theatre production teams. 

## The Aim
I want to create a piece of software that has the following features
 - User interface for the stage manager to see what is going on at lighting console, sound desk, TheatreControl and in QLab
 - User interface for operators to view a syncronised clock and stopwatch.
 - Connection to lighting console, sound desk, TheatreControl and Qlab via OSC over websockets
 - Webserver to serve user interfaces on a local network
